# Car Rental Manager

The system contains a list of cars, for which the following features need to be implemented:
- **Selection by brand**;
- **Selection by quality class**;
- **Sorting by rental cost**;
- **Sorting by name**.

The client selects a car and places a rental order. In the order details, the client specifies:
- Passport information;
- The option for 'with driver' / 'without driver';
- The rental period.

The system generates an **invoice**, which the client pays.

The client reviews the order and can reject it, providing a reason. The client also:
- Registers the return of the vehicle;
- In the case of damage to the car, an invoice for repairs is issued through the system.

The client can:
- Search for cars by name;
- Add cars;
- Delete cars;
- Edit car information.
